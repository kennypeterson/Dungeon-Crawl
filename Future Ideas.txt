Enemy Text Samples
	TBD Final Boss - "towering sumthin-ruther with a blade the length of your body"
		#really only need one set of these since the encounter is scripted
		is_near = "You've got a bad feeling about this..."
		is_examined = "The creature's head nearly scrapes the ceiling of the hall. You wonder how it got in here..."
		is_defeated = "The beasts heavy body falls to the floor with a resonating blow... "
	
	Walking Bones - "very common, skellington with low base stats, slow and weak, ALMOST never crits"
		#variety in descs would be helpful and interesting
		is_near = "You hear rattling echoes against the hard cavern walls..."
		is_examined = "The skeleton's bones rattle rythmically as its' souless cavernous eyes wander."
		is_defeated = "The shattered bits of bone collapse to the floor as the spirit's will fades."
	
	Vicious Rat - "common, ROUS, aka rodent of unusual size, makes festering wounds"
	
	Rat King - "mini-boss, group of ROUS with their tails tangled together, makes festering wounds"
	
	Mimic - "very low-chance encounter, a disguised treasure chest"
	
	Shambler - "uncommon, hunched man with no concept of humanity, yells and screams"
	
	Rotting Hound - "uncommon, mangy dog that travels in packs often, howls(yells), makes festering wounds"
	
	Shadow - "30% encounter chance, a dark spirit composed of thick fog, causes cough, heavy breathing"
		#this tricky bugger isn't affected by physical attacks. magic only (maybe magic/enchanted weapons too)
		when attacked physically = "You swing your sword thru the shadow. It hums smuggly."
		is_near = "The air is thick and musty, the walls are dripping with condensation."
		is_examined = "The dark figure floats at eye level with long thin arms stretching out from the veil of fog."
		is_defeated = "The fog disperses slowly as the shadow is cast away."
		
current properties "specific to the now conditions"
	torch = "float, percentage of light being cast, decays over time"
	campfire = "bool, could lure enemies"
	light = "float, ambient light"
	wet_floor = "reduces agility, chance to slip(small)"
	fog = "reduces accuracy"
	smoke = "reduces accuracy, heavy_breathing"
	
magic properties "powerful but at a high cost. found in tomes, default 1 is defined by class, used in or out of fights"
	cast_spark = "low-cost, starts fire to dry hay or oil, cauterizes wounds, may take a few tries"
	cast_ember = "low-cost, start fire to a campfire"
	cast_splash = "low-cost, small amount of water, cleans wound or weapon, may take a few tries"
	cast_light = "low-med cost torch alternative"
	cast_detect = "low-med cost, detects magic (use??)"
	cast_key = "med-cost, unlocks locked door"
	cast_heal = "med-cost, NOT A SELF-HEAL, SELF-HEALS ARE NOT CANON, heals a target"
			
		
Event Specifics
	crit_events = "qualifiers including how big target is, location, type of weapon, your class, etc"
	item_find = "class qualifiers, torch?"
	lowchance_enemy = "torch, items, passive_action qualifiers"
	
injury properties
	head_cond = "float, bad stuff happens when low, effects below 50 stack"
		<= 100 (Clear headed, no negative effects)
		<= 90  (Lightheaded, small text reminders)
		<= 80  (Light headache stemming from blow to head or exposure to smoke)
		<= 50  (Severe headache, non-treated head wound or prolonged exposure to smoke)
		<= 40  (Visions, harsh accuracy and speed penalties)
		<= 20  (Function Loss, harsh attack and defense penalties)
		<= 10  (High crit chances, almost defenseless)
		<= 0   (Death, pretty self-explanatory)
	right_arm_cond = "float, lower attack if dominant_hand"
	left_arm cond = "float, lower defense if not dominant_hand"
	legs_cond = "float, stumbling possible, lowers agility"
		<= 100 (Sturdy footing, no negative effects)
		<= 60  (Limp, chance for stumble and attack or dodge miss)
		<= 10  (Crawl, harsh speed penalty)
	torso_cond = "float, similar to head_cond with lower consequences"
	body_cond = "multi-prop, overall health, poisons and heals apply"
		poisoned = "slow health loss"
		heavy_breathing = "agility penalty"
		open_wound = "left undressed, area of cond will deteriorate"
		festering_wound = "harder to dress, same effect as open_wound"
		cough = "left unchecked, could lead to diasease?"
		cursed = "effects are unknown and random until a random event is triggered"
